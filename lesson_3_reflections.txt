>When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When i want to keep my a backup of data & keep different versions online so that i can access it from any location.
  Also when i would like others to contribute to my project or show my project to other people.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because even if we make small changes online in GitHub and have different version offline, then we don't want to update the repository automatically. Also when we make major changes then only we want pull it from GitHub.

>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks are used on github to copy repository from other users to our repository, so that we can make changes to it according to our needs. clones are used to make local copies of repositories in our system from github website. branches are used to make differnet features or versions parralely in one repository and can be later merged into master.

>What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	when we are going offline for a long time & we may want to see previous commits that time having a local copy of last known remote comes in use.
